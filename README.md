Implementation of CPL layer from Cezanne-ai framework

This layer/pipeline is common for all types of languages/domains and is recommended to be implemented accordingly.

If other codes are available and are more efficient than the one implemented by us, feel free to use them if the main fundamentals presented in the CPL file are followed.

Code implementation in progress.
Possible commit date: 1st November 2021.

Please check for details: Project-documentation repository (Cezanne-ai project file) and the research paper "Cezanne-ai: a conversational AI framework for emerging languages and limited data".
